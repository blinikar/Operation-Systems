Firstly, the perfomance increasing when count of threads increasing, but perfomance
reaches some limit when threads count increasing, because the processor of my laptop 
can't handle more than 4 threads instanly, so after creating more than 4 threads there
is no difference in perfomance.

Secondly, compairing results with the 3rd task there is some difference in perfomance.
4th works faster (or equal) than 3rd, because each thread has the same level of 
work as each other, when in the 3rd approach there is differnt level of thread's load.
